# Basketball-Database

This database and queries have been developed using Oracle SQL developer.

This database is designed to monitor players pay and their affiliated sponsors for each game of a single basketball league season. The system is in place to make the league more financially transparent about players pay and sponsor affiliations. Although it is designed to be a comprehensive database of every game, player, team and sponsor, for the purposes of this assessment a reduced fictious data set has been implemented and is a representation of how such data would be organised and queried.

•	Each player, team and sponsor have submitted their Email details, to enable the league to contact them on an individual basis.
•	Home venue details have been recorded to enable sponsors to measure advertising exposure (although this is not something this database is directly concerned with).
•	Players are only paid for the amount of minutes they play per game.
•	Details of minutes played and sponsor affiliations are submitted after each game. 
•	A basketball game lasts for 48 minutes and there is never overtime.
•	Each player negotiated their wage per minute at the start of the season and submitted it to this database. The League has a cap of $9,999,999.99 per minute on players wages.
•	A player cannot transfer team or re-negotiate their wage per minute until the season is over. 
•	Each team is funded by the league. 
•	The league is funded by sponsors. 
•	Part of the sponsorship deal is: for a minimum of one game a season, a sponsor will be affiliated with a minimum of one player (of their choice), to run an advertising campaign at any game (of their choice). 
•	Players are not paid by the sponsors. Affiliations are the way in which sponsors get a return on their investment into the league.
•	Essentially, sponsors fund the league, and teams compete to win a proportion of this money to pay their players. Players are affiliated with sponsors, which in turn helps fund the league.
